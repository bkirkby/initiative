initiative

a meteor application that keeps track of an RPG turn-based 
queue. you can play with a running example of this at 
http://initiative.meteor.com

how to run:
1. install meteor: 'curl https://install.meteor.com | sh'
2. run 'meteor' in the project directory
3. browse to http://localhost:3000/

this is a quick hack-a-thon project i did to experience meteor.

KNOWN BUGS:

1. sometimes a refresh of the page does not get a full list of 
those in the encounter. think this might be a meteor or a 
meteor/hosted problem

2. after youu make an edit of an entry, the controls stop work so you have 
to reload the page
